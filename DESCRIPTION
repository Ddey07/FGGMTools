Description: (a) Performs iterative proportional scaling (IPS) to get graph-constrained MLE in Gaussian Graphical Models, (b) Performs graph-constrained functional principal 
    component analysis for multivariate functional data. The methods are described in 
    Dey, Banerjee, Lindquist and Datta (2023) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06294.pdf>.
